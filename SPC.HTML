        <p style="color:blue">1.Moon Missions-<br>
            So, Let's start with the Moon Missions. The Moon is the only satellite that orbits the Earth. The humans
            needed to know about it.The first spacecraft to land on Moon was Luna 9. The first human landing was on July
            20, 1969. The landing was successful. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were the first humans
            to land on the Moon. The Moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System. The Moon is the
            fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System. The Moon has no Atmosphere. It is said to be the part
            of the Earth which was once covered with water. One asteroid hit the Moon in 1969. The asteroid was named
            Phobos. Our country India has sent 3 rovers to the Moon. The latest one was Chandrayaan 3. India was the 1st
            country to land on the southern pole of the Moon. The Moon still has a lot to study.Till now, our Moon
            remains a mystery.</p>
        <p style="color:orange">2.Mars Rovers-<br>
            A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars. Rovers have
            several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting
            features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the
            knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital
            spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is the Mars helicopter.It has helped
            the humans to find a lot of informantion about Mars. There are total 6 rovers launched on Mars. Soon humans
            will explrore Mars also. </p>
        <p style="color:crimson">3.International Space Station-<br>
            The International Space Station (ISS) is a large space station assembled and maintained in low Earth orbit
            by a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia),
            JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The ISS is the largest space station ever built. Its primary
            purpose is to perform microgravity and space environment experiments.

            Operationally, the station is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) assembled by
            Roscosmos, and the US Orbital Segment, assembled by NASA, JAXA, ESA and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS
            is the Integrated Truss Structure, which connects the large solar panels and radiators to the pressurized
            modules. The pressurized modules are specialized for research, habitation, storage, spacecraft control, and
            airlock functions. Visiting spacecraft dock at the station via its eight docking and berthing ports. The ISS
            maintains an orbit with an average altitude of 400 kilometres (250 mi) and circles the Earth in roughly 93
            minutes, completing 15.5 orbits per day.
        <p style="color:aqua">4.Telescopes and Stars-<br>
            A telescope is a device used to observe distant objects by their emission, absorption, or reflection of
            electromagnetic radiation.It was made by Hans Lipperhey. Originally it was an optical instrument using
            lenses, curved mirrors, or a combination of both to observe distant objects â€“ an optical telescope.
            Nowadays, the word "telescope" is defined as a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different
            regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors.
            The first known practical telescopes were refracting telescopes with glass lenses and were invented in the
            Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century. They were used for both terrestrial applications and
            astronomy.
            The reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades
            of the first refracting telescope.
            In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and
            infrared telescopes in the 1960s.
        <p style="color:magenta">5.Black Holes Mysteries-<br>
            A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other
            electromagnetic waves, is capable of possessing enough energy to escape it.Einstein's theory of general
            relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary
            of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of
            an object crossing it, but it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.In many
            ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.Quantum field theory in curved
            spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a
            temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin
            for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
